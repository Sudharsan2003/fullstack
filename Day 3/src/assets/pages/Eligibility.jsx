        <h2>Eligibility for Applying Loans</h2>
        <p>
          To apply for loans , individuals need to meet certain eligibility criteria set by financial institutions. These criteria may vary depending on the type of loan and the lender, but some common eligibility requirements include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Age: Applicants typically need to be at least 18 years old to apply for a loan.</li>
          <li>Income: Lenders may require applicants to have a minimum level of income to qualify for a loan.</li>
          <li>Employment: Some loans may require applicants to be employed or have a stable source of income.</li>
          <li>Credit history: Lenders will assess the applicant  credit history to determine their creditworthiness.</li>
          <li>Collateral: Secured loans may require applicants to provide collateral, such as property or assets, to secure the loan.</li>
          <li>Residency: Applicants may need to be residents of India to apply for certain loans.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It is important to note that meeting these eligibility criteria does not guarantee approval for a loan. Lenders will also consider other factors such as the applicant debt-to-income ratio, repayment capacity, and the purpose of the loan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before applying for a loan, individuals should carefully review the eligibility requirements and compare loan options from different lenders to find the best fit for their financial needs.
